/*
    This is the interface for Lab00 in COSC310.  Create a class that implements
        this interface in the same package and call it LnameFnameLab00.

    The purpose of this lab is primarily to get used to coding again, but it
        will also help us to begin using Github.  All of our code will
        be committed to Github Classroom, so please familiarize yourself with it.

    If you do not have a Github account, please create one using the link
        provided.  If you do have an account already, you will need to tie it
        to this classroom account.

    !! Don't forget to commit your completed code to github.  This is how
        I will grade it !!
